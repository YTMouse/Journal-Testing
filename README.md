I set-up this account after setting up an account for freecodecamp, and I plan to use that site and Khan Academy for my expirementing here...
<p>
I don't know if I shall find any other sites to help me along in my journey, but I may also use some books too on this journey of learning. It should be fun, and there are so many options to study!
<p>
This will be part of the start of my learning goals in 2017- and beyond! Goodreads reading at least 100 books, and I am going to check out some free classes in my area and stuff...I was doing A.B.E. classes last year, but I had to take a break with changings that came into my life that put a damper in my learning and other facets of my life. This year I think that however I can do more on my personal educational goals, and though there will be obstacles I will have better support. I have a lifeskills coach, and will start working with a Peer Support Specialist(not drug or sobriety related but because I am struggling with anxiety and depression) soon not that I need to tell anyone else, but simply because I am making this recording for my own ability to look back on this in the future.

That is all as far as my ramblings go for now anyways, and I hope I continue to grow and learn here.
